  "title": "A Software Architect\u0027s Level-Headed Take on Vibe Coding",
  "text": "You’ve heard it all over the news: Everyone is using AI and vibe coding!\u003cp\u003eTechCrunch says all these startups generate code using AI.\u003cp\u003eIf Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella says 30% of the company\u0026#x27;s code is written by AI, you know Google, Meta, and Amazon probably claim something similar.\u003cp\u003eYou get the impression everyone is using AI coding assistants in some way.\u003cp\u003eI experimented with vibe coding (to test its utility and limitations) and have a few thoughts I’d like to share. And in brief, vibe coding is great, but because of its limitations, it is definitely not for everyone and the tool is not a fit for all use cases.\u003cp\u003eI know, this is a classic “it depends” answer. But here is my take on what it depends.\u003cp\u003eAs a software architect and the owner of a software services company, I believe AI and vibe coding can be used as tools for specific tasks, with advantages and limitations.\u003cp\u003eI probably don’t need to summarize the positive side: juniors learn faster, coding now being accessible for non-technical people. Using intuition, improvisation, and immediate feedback instead of detailed planning, formal specifications, or extensive analysis as a founder you can test ideas, iterate various possibilities, and launch creative or innovative solutions faster. It\u0026#x27;s a magic stick for early-stage startups, hackathons, and personal projects where speed, creativity, and exploration are key.\u003cp\u003eOn the negative side, if you work on mission-critical apps, existing production environments, or need to pass compliance for security, reliability, or scalability, thread carefully. Projects that need detailed documentation, long-term maintainability, and predictable behavior need a certain set of conditions and limitations not all AI code gen tools get right.\u003cp\u003eWhy do big corporations use it? They have private, stable code bases, standard coding practices, and rarely need to worry about compatibility because their code base doesn’t need frequent changes. It’s important to know this code is each corporation’s most valuable intellectual property, so it’s their most closely guarded secret that they can use internally. But that code is not available for training public AI models.\u003cp\u003eSo unless you’re a corporation with time-tested code, you’ll be using open-source code AI is usually trained on. Most of that code is experimental and written by Junior-level developers.\u003cp\u003eWould you trust ChatGPT for open heart surgery advice, flight control systems, NASA space mission code?\u003cp\u003eThis is why an average vibe coder will not be able to build safety-critical systems, financial software, and complex enterprise apps from the ground up because AI code generators don’t have access to most of the code IP, and vibe coders don’t have domain knowledge, haven’t developed a structured, carefully planned, and rigorously validated development methodology to make up for what AI code generators are missing.\u003cp\u003eMy take is that if you take a widely used coding language, AI code gen is more likely to work well, as there is enough publicly available training data available.\u003cp\u003eFor non-coders, I’d say vibe coding should eventually be good enough to create simple apps and sites. For everything else, you’ll need to work on expanding your domain expertise, as you’d want to know the options and trade-offs available to you so that the AI doesn’t make a decision for you while you are not aware of its consequences.\u003cp\u003eAnd lastly, on the TechCrunch hype. I’d like to see the analysis of the code, where that code was used, and take a look at the code AI wrote. Until then, don’t believe hype seeking announcements unless there is something concrete to back them up.",

  "text": "Hi HN!\u003cp\u003eWe just launched Codacy Guardrails, an IDE extension with a CLI for code analysis and MCP server that enforces security \u0026amp; quality rules on AI-generated code in real-time. It hooks into AI coding assistants (like VS Code Agent Mode, Cursor, Windsurf), silently scanning and fixing AI-suggested code that has vulnerabilities or violates your coding standards, while the code it’s being generated.\u003cp\u003eWe built this because coding agents can be a double-edged sword. They do boost productivity, but can easily introduce insecure or non-compliant code. One recent research team at NYU found that 40% of Copilot’s outputs were buggy or exploitable [1]. Other surveys mention that people are spending more time debugging AI-generated code [2].\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#x27;s why we created “guardrails” to catch security problems early.\u003cp\u003eCodacy Guardrails uses a collection of open-source static analyzers (like Semgrep and Trivy) to scan the AI’s output against 2000+ rules. We currently support JavaScript\u0026#x2F;TypeScript, Python, and Java, focusing on things like OWASP Top 10 vulns, hardcoded secrets, dependency checks, code complexity and styling violations, and you can customize the rules to match your project’s needs. We\u0026#x27;re not using any AI models, it\u0026#x27;s “classic” static code analysis working alongside your AI assistant.\u003cp\u003eHere’s a quick demo: \u003ca href\u003d\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;youtu.be\u0026#x2F;pB02u0ntQpM\" rel\u003d\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;youtu.be\u0026#x2F;pB02u0ntQpM\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe extension is free for all developers. (We do have paid plans for teams to apply rules centrally, but that’s not needed to use the extension and local code analysis with agents.)\u003cp\u003eSetup is pretty straightforward: Install the extension and enable Codacy’s CLI and MCP Server from the sidebar.\u003cp\u003eWe’re eager to hear what the HN community thinks! Does this approach sound useful in your AI coding workflow? Have you encountered security issues from AI-generated code?\u003cp\u003eWe hope Codacy Guardrails can make AI-assisted development a bit safer and more trustworthy.

  "title": "Show HN: Henosia – We built a JavaScript Engine for vibe coding",
  "text": "Hey HN, I\u0026#x27;m Jim – one half of the two-person team building Henosia (\u003ca href\u003d\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.henosia.com\u0026#x2F;\" rel\u003d\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.henosia.com\u0026#x2F;\u003c/a\u003e), a browser-based visual vibe coding tool with a purpose-built JavaScript Engine.\u003cp\u003eWhy would we do something as crazy as building our own JavaScript Engine? In a word, speed.\u003cp\u003eToday\u0026#x27;s vibe coding is built around files: Edit, save, a build is triggered, Hot Module Refresh triggers a file-level re-evaluation, the page re-renders. This means that code updates are much heavier and slower than they need to be, especially compared to how fast drawing and design tools can perform updates when you edit.\u003cp\u003eTo get design tool like speeds (60FPS) for vibe coding, edit operations need to happen at the lowest possible level: The syntax tree nodes. Changes to the syntax tree then need to cause a minimal amount of code to be re-evaluated in the browser, which is where our purpose-built JavaScript Engine comes into play. Well, technically it\u0026#x27;s a TypeScript Engine, because it directly evaluates TypeScript syntax trees (ASTs), skipping over non-executable nodes like type annotations.\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026#x27;s how it works: The engine receives a change in the AST because the user made a visual edit of a selected component using our component props panel, e.g. to change the size property on a Button component. We\u0026#x27;re currently focusing on React, so the engine identifies the closest most fine-grained way to perform the rendering update, which in this case is to re-render the nearest parent component that owns the Button component. This happens in just a few milliseconds, and we\u0026#x27;re able to optimistically perform the change on the client before distributing the change to the server.\u003cp\u003eSince we\u0026#x27;re not bound to file save operations and file watchers, we can have multiple pending draft edits at once, e.g. to present the user with multiple AI-based edit suggestions. This capability opens up a ton of new ways to interact with code, with design tools and code editors converging into something entirely new.\u003cp\u003eIf you want to see this thing in action, head over to \u003ca href\u003d\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.henosia.com\" rel\u003d\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.henosia.com\u003c/a\u003e and drop a prompt to get the project started. Use the selection tool, it\u0026#x27;s the button with a pen on a bullseye icon next to the chat input. This starts our code engine, and you\u0026#x27;re able to instantly preview and edit Tailwind styling and component properties at 60FPS. Our docs at \u003ca href\u003d\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;docs.henosia.com\u0026#x2F;edit\u0026#x2F;select\" rel\u003d\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;docs.henosia.com\u0026#x2F;edit\u0026#x2F;select\u003c/a\u003e have more info, and \u003ca href\u003d\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.youtube.com\u0026#x2F;watch?v\u003d5yqsFGt7zAg\" rel\u003d\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.youtube.com\u0026#x2F;watch?v\u003d5yqsFGt7zAg\u003c/a\u003e walks through the capabiliies.\u003cp\u003eI’d love to hear what you think about our approach, and where we should take it next :)\u003cp\u003ePS: For a limited time our free plan includes unlimited AI messages and visual edits.",
